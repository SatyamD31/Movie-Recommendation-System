# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie/TV series recommendation system made with python, flask, html, css and javascript that works on the principle of Content Based Recommendation and uses cosine similarity to make recommendations. Required datasets are obtained by scraping the IMDb website and performing data wrangling, cleaning and imputation afterwards. Working demo of the system can be found [here](http://satyamdutta.pythonanywhere.com/).
